These files are not currently used in the workflows that generate pages.
They're here in case anyone is wondering where this project is headed.
The idea is to have two files for each text: the tree, plus a syllable file that specifies metrical data.
Each syllable syncs to the tree via word id and sentence id.
One might consider the syllable file to be the standoff xml, though it can just as easily be looked at the other way around.
